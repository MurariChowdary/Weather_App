This Weather App allows users to get real-time weather data for any location worldwide. It provides essential weather information such as temperature, humidity, weather description, and feels-like temperature.

Key Features:
Search City: Users can search the weather in any city by typing the name in the search bar.
Current Location Weather: Fetches present weather conditions using geolocation based on the user's current location.
Real-time Data: Weather information is dynamically fetched from the OpenWeather API.
Weather Description and Icon: Displays a detailed description of the weather conditions along with a matching icon.
Responsiveness: Fully responsive design that works well on all screen sizes, including mobile devices.

JavaScript (ES6): Used to dynamically fetch and display weather data.
OpenWeather API: Provides real-time weather data.
Font Awesome: Adds icons to enhance the user interface.
